Installing Anaconda
===================

We will be using the Anaconda distribution of Python in this class.  It is a very complete installation of Python plus nearly all of the packages you will need for many years of data science productivity are included in the initial installation.

The Good people who have created Anaconda have also provided a very nice set of instructors to help you install it the first time.  There are instructions for Windows, macOS, and Linux.  The `installation guide <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html#>`_ is also part of a larger set of documentation that you may find useful.  Make sure you follow the instructions for a Regular Installation of Anaconda.  Not miniconda or a silent installation.
