Introduction
============

As you might expect, Data Science involves more than just Google Sheets or Excel. 
In later chapters, you will learn how to use data frames, databases, screen scraping, 
data visualization, and other concepts and tools essential to data scientists. Before 
you can learn these, however, you must have a rudimentary understanding of a programming 
language. In this chapter, you will get an introduction to Python.  Python is powerful, 
easy to learn, and one of the most used programming languages in the data science field. 
You will also set up the tools you will be using throughout the entire course.
