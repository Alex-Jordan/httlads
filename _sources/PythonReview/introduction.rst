Introduction
============

As you might expect, Data Science involves more than just Google Sheets 
or Excel. In later chapters, you will learn how to use data frames, databases, 
screen scraping, data visualization, and other concepts and tools essential to 
data scientists. Before you can learn these, however, you must have a rudimentary 
understanding of a programming language. In this chapter, you will get an introduction 
to Python.  Python is powerful, easy to learn, and one of the most used programming 
languages in the data science field. You will also set up the tools you will be 
using throughout the entire course.
