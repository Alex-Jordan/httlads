Introduction
============

intro paragraph : Why should they care about python?

In this chapter you will get an introduction to Python programming language as well 
as set up the tools you will be using throughout the entire course. You will realize 
that Data Science involves more than just Google Sheets or Excel. In later chapters 
you will learn about how to use data frames, data bases, screen scraping, data visualization, 
and many more tools. Before we can learn those tools, we must have a rudementary understanding 
of a programming language. In this chapter, you will learn a new programming language 
called Python. Data scientists will often have to work with a variety of tools. Python 
will allow you to use Jupyter Notebooks as well as other tools based on Jupyter Notebooks 
like Google Colab. 

python is one of the two primary languages for DS. that is why we are using it because it is very powerful.
