Markdown Cells
==============

Notebook interface is a virtual environment that resembles a real-life research notebook. 
A form of Literate Programming, it allows for the possibility of not only writing code but 
also inspecting and documenting its results as a piece of literature understandable for 
human beings. As you will learn later, the only way to document anything in a pure code 
environment is to use comments and docstrings, which is not convenient for Data Scientists 
interested in reproducible research and open access for everyone, even its non-technical users. 
So, a great advantage of a Notebook environment is being able to combine both code and nicely 
formatted text or graphics to easily document your flows. 

The industry standard of a Notebook environment is Jupyter Notebook, a free, open-source 
interactive web-based computational Notebook. Though computational notebooks existed long 
before Jupyter Notebook, its multi-language programming capabilities are what made it the 
industry standard. Even its name, Jupyter, is an acronym for all of its coding languages - 
Julia, Python, and R. Currently, there are many Notebook environments for the users to choose 
from. In this book, we will highlight Google Colab as an installation-free, cloud-based version 
of a Notebook environment.

There are two types of cells in Notebooks: code cells and text cells. One of the differences 
between the two types of cells is their variety. While code cells will vary in their format 
based on the programming language used, the text cells will always use a universally recognized 
text format language known as Markdown.

Markdown is a lightweight Markup (human-readable syntax) language that many consider being a 
key authoring framework for data science. Markdown allows for capabilities like bolding, italicizing, 
or making headers similar to word processing tools Google Docs or Microsoft Word.

Markdown Cells are run in the same way as Code Cells by pressing on the Run button or holding 
the Shift + Return keys. Outside of Notebooks, you can use Markdown to create a web page, pdf, 
MS Word document, slide show, and a whole host of other file types.

To learn more about Jupyter Notebooks installation and instructions for use, see the relevant 
section in the Appendix. To learn more about Google Collab, a similar cloud-based Notebook that 
will not require any installations on your computer, see the Colab section in the Appendix.
