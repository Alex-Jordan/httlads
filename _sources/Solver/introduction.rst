Introduction
============
In this chapter, we will explore how to use optimization modeling to achieve a stated business objective.  Optimization will produce an optimal mix of variables from portions of the dataset, which will provide an expected optimized outcome.  An optimization model is made up of 3 components, the objective function (the variable being optimized), the decision variables (those elements that will change to achieve the optimization) and the business constraints (the elements that create limitations).  For example, if we want to maximize profits when selling products, we can use optimization to find the right mix of variables & constraints (such as inventory & budget) that will provide us with the highest projected outcome (such as maximizing profits).  Optimization can be used to find maximum values (such as profits), minimum values (such as costs) or specifically stated values (such as budget amounts) to achieve the business objective.  

We will use a tool called Solver to manipulate a small business dataset using Google Sheets.  Solver can also be used with Microsoft Excel and many other spreadsheet programs. Solver asks the user to identify which cell in the dataset should represent the objective function (the dependent variable to be maximized, minimized or to meet a specified value,) by changing a cell or set of cells (the independent variables) and to specify the constraints that must be met to achieve the optimization.  

Learning Goals
--------------

- Explore the importance of **optimization**.
- Learn how to optimize an **objective function** under specific **constraints**.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

- Be able to recognize an **objective function** and any **constraints** in a specific set of data.
- Be able to apply opitimization in order to maximize profit, minimize loss or to reach a specific level of inventory, money or amount of time.
- Be able to use Solver as a tool to optimize an **objective function**.
