Introduction
============
In this chapter, we will explore how to use optimization techniques to achieve
a stated objective.  Optimization techniques will produce the best mix of elements from
a dataset in order to meet an expected optimized outcome. An
optimization model consists of 3 components, the objective function (the 
variable being optimized), the decision variables (those elements that will 
change to achieve the optimization), and the constraints (the elements that 
create limitations).  These concepts will be covered in more detail later in the chapter. 

We will use a tool called Solver to manipulate a small dataset using Google
Sheets.  Solver can also be used with Microsoft Excel and many other 
spreadsheet programs. 

Learning Goals
--------------
- Explore the ideas and techniques of **optimization**.
- Learn how to optimize an **objective function** under specific **constraints**.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

- Be able to recognize an **objective function** and any **constraints** in a specific problem.
- Learn to apply opitimization concepts to maximize or minimize an **objective function** or to set it to a specified value.
- Use Solver as a tool to optimize an **objective function** for a specific scenario.
