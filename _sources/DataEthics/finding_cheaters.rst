Finding the Cheaters
====================


In this lesson you are going to do a simplified version of the analysis outlined in the The Tennis Racket article.  I have prepared an anonymized data file for you that contains a numeric identifier instead of a name, along with the starting odds and the ending odds of a number of tennis matches.  Your goal is to identify the cheaters.  You can get the anonymous from `puzzle_anon.csv <../_static/puzzle_anon.csv`_.


.. mchoice:: mc_ethics_anon_cheaters
   :random:

   Check the ids of all of the cheaters here.

   - 7002589994262273027

     + Cheater number 1

   - 2416068425895372125

     + Cheater number 2

   - 1547483661413497428

     + Cheater number 3

   - 6228119144908428867

     + Cheater number 4

   - 1718561694846009025

     + Cheater number 5

   - 4643766977283546131

     - You accuse an innocent person

   - 1693568023468297046

     - You accuse an innocent person

   - All are cheaters

     - No, not everyone is a cheater

   - All are honest

     - No, not everyone is honest


Now that you have identified the cheaters can you match the cheaters with their real names.  Here is a dataset that contains their names `puzzle_real.csv <../_static/puzzle_real.csv>`_

   Match the numeric identifiers from the first part of the project with the real names.
