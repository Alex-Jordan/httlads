Please make sure you check the license for any data set you are going to use.  Nearly all of them are going to be fine for you to use in an educational setting, but its good to get in the habit of understanding the limitations of what you can and cannot do with the data.

One restriction that is important to pay attention to is whether or not you can redistribute the data.  Most data set owners do not want you to redistribute their data.  You should respect that and document a link to the original data, not your own copy of the data. You should always acknowledge the source of your data as part of your documentation.  Many dataset owners even provide you with their preferred way for you to cite a dataset.  This is because much of the data that is available to you for free is the result of some academic research work.   It is important to the career(s) of the researchers that they are given appropriate credit for the work they have done and have published.  It is also just good practice as a member of the scientific community.  Most researchers are keenly interested in what others learn from their data and if you cite it properly it makes it easy for them to learn about your own work.

 Even if you clean it up!  You should never republish or redistribute the data under a different license than the data was provided to you.
