Introduction
============

Data are a ubiquitous part of our everyday lives. Through text, pictures, or 
social media, the data that we upload and interact with reflect who we are. 
Data are incredibly useful in understanding patterns inherent in both people 
and the rest of the world. To ensure the appropriateness of their work, 
data scientists have an obligation to ask themselves the following questions:

- Are we using the data for the greater good? 
- Is the data that we are using invading people's privacy? 

In short, it is imperative for data scientists to consider the ethical implications 
of their work. They must also do so when merging data from multiple sources. They 
should ask questions such as:

- Will the ethics of the project stay the same after the merge? 

- Does the merger reveal information that invades people's privacy?
