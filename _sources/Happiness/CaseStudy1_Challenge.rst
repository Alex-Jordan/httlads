Case Study 1 Challenge: Calculating a Correlation Matrix
========================================================

Early on in our exploration of the business data, we calculated the correlation 
between the business score and the different factors. Now we have more data and more 
factors to continue, and we might ask a more general question about which of our columns 
are correlated with each other. A common way to do this is to build a correlation matrix. 
The rows and the columns of the correlation matrix represent each of our different factors 
and the individual values in the cells of the matrix represent the correlation between each pair of factors.

The following table is an example of a correlation matrix. Suppose we have three factors A, B, and C.

- A and B have a correlation of 0.7

- A and C have a correlation of -0.5

- B and C have a correlation of 0.9
