Part III Comparing Happiness Data across years
==============================================

We have two files of happiness data, one for 2017 that you have been using, and another for `2012 <../_static/happiness_2012.csv>`_ so you can do some comparisons across a span of five years.

#. Start a new workbook and get each of the csv files for the happiness data loaded into a separate sheet.

#. Now lets create a table on a new sheet that shows the happiness rank for each country for each year.  You'll have 4 columns country name, 2012 rank, and 2017 rank.  Hint: Use VLOOKUP 

#. Next let us find the biggest movers from 2012 to 2017 

#. Add two more columns score 2012, and score 2017 Do the countries with the biggest movement in their rank have correspondingly large changes in the scores?

#. For the five countries with the largest changes changes in ranking between 2012 and 2017 what are the factors that changed the most? For this part you can do this by making comparisons between sheets rather than creating a huge number of new columns on this summary sheet.

#. The choropleth gave us some insight into how happiness may be related to the continent.  It was pretty clear that African nations were less happy than many others.  Lets see if we can quantify that.

   a. First we need to find a file that helps us map from country to continent.  Lets add this to our file as a new worksheet.

   b. How can we add a column (or a few columns) to our happiness spreadsheet from this spreadsheet?   -- VLOOKUP

   c. Once we have the continent name added to the spreadsheet can we find the average happiness score for each continent?
