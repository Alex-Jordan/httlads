Introduction
============

In this chapter, we will explore the concepts of descriptive statistics such as normal distribution, measures of central tendency, measures of variability and other related concepts.  We will learn the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics and will explore various data types in statistics such as categorical & numerical types.

We will need a spreadsheet application to manipulate the data in the chapter to solve problems.  There are many types of spreadsheets, such as Excel (a proprietary spreadsheet application) & Google Sheets (a web-based spreadsheet application).  We will use Google Sheets because it is free, works from any device (like your laptop, tablet or phone) and includes functions that are very similar to Excel.  So, if you are familiar with Microsoft Excel, you will find Google Sheets easy to use.

Lastly, we will discuss the difference between correlation and causation and explore why correlation does not imply causation.  Understanding this concept is important for making correct assumptions and decisions when analyzing data.

Learning Goals
--------------
