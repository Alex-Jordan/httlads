Introduction
============

In this chapter, we will explore concepts of descriptive statistics such as normal distribution, measures of central tendency, measures of variability, and other related concepts.  We will learn the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics and will explore various data types in statistics such as categorical and numerical types.

We will use a spreadsheet application to manipulate the data in the chapter to solve problems because they are one of the best tools for this particular work.  Many spreadsheets exist but perhaps the most ubiquitous are Excel (a commercial spreadsheet application) and Google Sheets (a web-based spreadsheet application).  We will use Google Sheets because it is free, works from almost any device (including your laptop, tablet, or phone) and because it includes functions that are very similar to Excel.  So, if you are familiar with Microsoft Excel, you will find Google Sheets very easy to use.

Lastly, we will discuss the difference between correlation and causation and explore why correlation does not imply causation.  Understanding this concept is important for making correct assumptions and decisions when analyzing data.
