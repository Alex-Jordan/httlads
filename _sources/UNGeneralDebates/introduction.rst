Introduction
=============


In this chapter, we will explore the concept of text analysis and how it can be interpreted through visualizations. 
First, we will look at the data set and its components and then merge it to another data frame to have a more precise 
and accurate data frame. Then, we will discuss how we can use various methods with data frames to clean up our data to 
better analyze. We will then shift our focus to identifying and graphing relationships between various variables in a 
data frame. Finally, we will focus on evaluating and interpreting a piece of text to identify whether the text is conveying 
a positive, negative or neutral sentiment. 


Learning Goals
---------------
- Analyze and measure text complexity
- Find relationships in, and make a visual representation from the text.
- Tidy up data into proper format for analysis
- Graph the relationship between different variables in a data set


Learning Objectives
--------------------
- Reshape and merge one data frame to another in order to create a more precise and consistent data frame
- Apply the basic principles of tidying up data
- Measure text complexity using the Python package textatistic
- Score and interpret various text using NLTK
